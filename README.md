### Question 1

Implementing the polygon triangulation problem:-
  -  Prepare a dataset for convex polygon with increasing number of arbitary vertices.
  -  Consider a brute force method where you do an exhaustive search for finding the optimal       result
  -  Next, apply dynamic programming, in line with the matrix chain multiplication problem.
  -  Then implement a greedy strategy to solve the same problem by choosing non-intersecting diagonals in sorted order.
  -  Finally compare the results and suggest whether the DP and Greedy approach results show any mismatch.
